wp2syslog -- Global logging facility for WordPress (WPsyslog revisited)

== Description ==

This plugin is forked from first 0.2 version of http://www.ossec.net/wpsyslog2/
already forked from the wpsyslog plugin by Alex Guensche ( http://www.zirona.com/software/donate ).

The firts version of this plugin was developed during a project with the German "Menschen f√ºr Tierrechte" (Humans for Animal Rights).
It is an organisation of activists who advocate animal rights and fight against abuse of animals. They generously decided to donate
this work to the general public by letting Zirona put it under the GNU GPL and allowing us to promote and distribute it.

Please support the work of Humans for Animal Rights, e.g. by placing a link to [Humans for Animal Rights](http://www.tierrechte.de/ "www.tierrechte.de") and
spreading the word. Not (only) because of this plugin, but generally for a better treatment of the beings on this planet.

== Installation ==
